	abstract = {This paper presents a general, fully Bayesian framework for sparse supervised-learning problems based on the horseshoe prior. The horseshoe prior is a member of the family of multivariate scale mixtures of normals, and is therefore closely related to widely used approaches for sparse Bayesian learning, including, among others, Laplacian priors (e.g. the LASSO) and Student-t priors (e.g. the relevance vector machine). The advantages of the horseshoe are its robustness at handling unknown sparsity and large outlying signals. These properties are justifed theoretically via a representation theorem and accompanied by comprehensive empirical experiments that compare its performance to benchmark alternatives.},

	abstract = {Clustering is a critical component of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis and can help reveal cell types and infer cell lineages. Despite considerable successes, there are few methods tailored to investigating cluster-specific genes contributing to cell heterogeneity, which can promote biological understanding of cell heterogeneity. In this study, we propose a zero-inflated negative binomial mixture model (ZINBMM) that simultaneously achieves effective scRNA-seq data clustering and gene selection. ZINBMM conducts a systemic analysis on raw counts, accommodating both batch effects and dropout events. Simulations and the analysis of five scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate the practical applicability of ZINBMM.},
